# ApRES_include

To run any ApRES script from my repositories you need to download this repository first and I highly recommend to create the following pattern:

copy the following script into your matlab path (Documents/Matlab/ThisIsAn_ApRES_Script.m)

ApRES
    _ApRES_include
    projects
        project1
            _src
            data
        project2
            _src
            data
